# 
#  CHANGELOG
#
#    2012-10-01 - Initial version (alex@mbird.biz)
#    2012-12-23 - Use /var/lib/mongo-mms-agent as home instead of /var/run/xxx
#                 since the latter causes problems after /var/run is cleaned
#                 out on reboot.
#    2012-12-23 - Change package version to reflect real mms-agent version;
#Â                 add .gitignore to prevent 10gen code getting in to github.
